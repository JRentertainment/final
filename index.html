        Today, hip hop continues to evolve, with artists experimenting with new
        sounds, styles, and production techniques. Some of the most popular
        sub-genres of hip hop today include trap, drill, and mumble rap. These
        styles are characterized by their heavy use of 808 drums, auto-tuned
        vocals, and trap melodies. Overall, the sound of hip hop has evolved
        significantly over the years, reflecting changes in technology, culture,
        and artistic expression. Despite these changes, hip hop remains one of
        the most influential and popular genres of music in the world today.
